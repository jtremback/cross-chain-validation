# Initialization

This documents tackles the initialization part of the cross-chain validation (CCV) protocol.
Namely, we need to ensure that (1) parent blockchain communicates with baby blockchain, (2) baby blockchain communicates with parent blockchain, and (3) these two blockchains communicate via a single channel.

We start by properly defining the properties of the initialization subprotocol.
Then, we provide the pseudocode and prove its correctness.

## Problem Definition

We assume that babyChain denotes the baby blockchain the parent blockchain wants to validate.
Similarly, parentChain denotes the parent blockchain which validates the baby blockchain, from the perspective of the baby blockchain.

The initialization exposes the following interface:
- Indication <Open, channel>: channel is open.

We ensure the following properties:

- **Parent Safety:** If <Open, channel> is triggered at parent blockchain, then channel is a channel between the parent and baby blockchain. [satisfied if the parent blockchain is "valid"]

- **Baby Safety:** If <Open, channel> is triggered at baby blockchain, then channel is a channel between the parent and baby blockchain. [satisfied if the baby blockchain is "valid"]

- **No Duplication:** There is no more than one channel open between two blockchains. [satisfied if the blockchain is "valid"]

- **Liveness:** A blockchain eventually triggers <Open, channel>. [satisfied if both blockchains are "valid"]

## Protocol

### Prerequisites

This subsection presents the state of both chains we assume at the start of the initialization subprotocol.
There exists a light client on the baby blockchain that follows the parent blockchain (denoted by BABY_LIGHT_CLIENT) and there exists a light client on the parent blockchain that follows the baby blockchain (denoted by PARENT_LIGHT_CLIENT).

### Parent Blockchain

```
upon <OnChanOpenTry, Order order, String portId, String channelId, Counterparty counterparty, String version, String counterpartyVersion>:
    // validate parameters, i.e., check whether order = "ORDERED", portId is the expected port, version is the expected version
    if (!validate(order, portId, channelId, version)):
        trigger <error>

    // check whether the version of the counterparty is the expected one
    if (counterpartyVersion != expectedCCVVersion):
        trigger <error>

    // create the channel, i.e., claim a capability
    Channel channel = new Channel(portId, channelId)
    // set its status to "INITIALIZING"
    channel.setStatus("INITIALIZING")

    // get the client
    client = getClient(channelId)

    // verify consensus state
    verifyConsensusState(client, initialValidatorSetBaby)

    // verify that there does not exist a CCV channel
    if (ccvChannelBaby != nil):
        trigger <error>
```
ßs
- **Initiator:** Relayer.
- **Expected precondition:** 
    - ChanOpenTry datagram committed on the blockchain.
    - PARENT_LIGHT_CLIENT is updated.
- **Expected postcondition:**
    - A channel is created; its status is set to "INITIALIZING".
    - A consensus state of the baby blockchain is verified againts its initial validator set.
- **Error condition:** 
    - If the precondition is violated.

```
upon <OnChanOpenConfirm, String portId, String channelId>:
    // verify that there does not exist a CCV channel
    if (ccvChannelBaby != nil):
        // if there is, make it invalid and close it
        ccvChannel.setStatus("INVALID")
        ccvChannel.close()
        trigger <error>
    
    // update the channel
    ccvChannel = getChannel(channelId)
    // make it valid
    ccvChannel.setStatus("VALID")

    // terminate
    trigger <Open, ccvChannel>
```

- **Initiator:** Relayer.
- **Expected precondition:** 
    - ChanOpenConfirm datagram committed on the blockchain.
    - PARENT_LIGHT_CLIENT is updated.
- **Expected postcondition:**
    - If this is the first OnChanOpenConfirm callback invoked, the paren blockchain terminates the initialization protocol with this channel (it sets its status to "VALID"); otherwise, the callback is ignored.
- **Error condition:** 
    - If the precondition is violated.

### Baby Blockchain

```
upon <OnChanOpenInit, Order order, String portId, String channelId, Counterparty counterparty, String version:
    // validate parameters, i.e., check whether order = "ORDERED", portId is the expected port, version is the expected version
    if (!validate(order, portId, channelId, version)):
        trigger <error>

    // create the channel, i.e., claim a capability
    Channel channel = new Channel(portId, channelId)
    // set its status to "INITIALIZING"
    channel.setStatus("INITIALIZING")

    // get the client
    client = getClient(channelId)

    // verify that the client is the expected client
    (client != expectedClient):
        trigger <error>
```
- **Initiator:** CCV module on the baby blockchain.
- **Expected precondition:** 
    - Connection among two blockchains has already been established.
- **Expected postcondition:**
    - A channel is created; its status is set to "INITIALIZING".
- **Error condition:** 
    - If the precondition is violated.

```
upon <OnChanOpenAck, String portId, String channelId, String counterpartyVersion>:
    // check if this is the first acknowledged channel
    if (alreadyAcknowledged):
        triger <error>

    // the first acknowledged channel
    alreadyAcknowledged = true

    // check the version of the counterparty
    if (counterpartyVersion != expectedVersion): 
        trigger <error>    
    
    trigger <Terminate, parentChain, getChannel(channelId)>
```
- **Initiator:** Relayer.
- **Expected precondition:** 
    - ChanOpenAck datagram committed on the blockchain.
    - BABY_LIGHT_CLIENT is updated.
- **Expected postcondition:**
    - If this is the first OnChanOpenAck callback invoked, the baby blockchain terminates the initialization protocol with this channel; otherwise, the callback is ignored.
- **Error condition:** 
    - If the precondition is violated.

## Correctness Arguments

- **Parent Safety:** This property is satisfied because the underlying client is the one expected and the consensus state of the baby blockchain is verified.

- **Baby Safety:** This property is a consequence of the constantly updated light client of the parent blockchain on the baby blockchain.

- **No Duplication:** The property is ensured by the fact that just a single channel passes the "alreadyAcknowledged" check.

- **Liveness:** Ensured since the handshake is eventually completed.
