# Technical Specification

## Introduction

This document presents a technical specification for the **Cross-Chain Validation** protocol.
The basic idea of the Cross-Chain Validation protocol is to allow validators that are already securing some existing blockchain (parent blockchain) to also secure a "new" blockchain (baby blockchain).
The stake bonded at the parent blockchain guarantees that a validator behaves correctly at the baby blockchain.
If the validator misbehaves at the baby blockchain, its stake will be slashed at the parent blockchain.

Therefore, at a high level, we can imagine the Cross-Chain Validation protocol to be concerned with following entities:
  - Parent blockchain: This is a blockchain that "provides" validators. Namely, "provided" validators have some stake at the parent blockchain. Any misbehavior of a validator is slashed at the parent blockchain. Moreover, parent blockchain manipulates the validator set of a chain that "borrows" validators from it.
  - Baby blockchain: Baby blockchain is a blockchain that is being secured by the parent blockchain. In other words, validators that secure and operate the baby blockchain are bonded on the parent blockchain. Any misbehavior of a validator at the baby blockchain is punished at the parent blockchain (i.e., the validator is slashed at the parent blockchain).
  - IBC channel: IBC channel allows the parent and baby blockchain to communicate. We assume that the IBC channel is ordered and provides "timeout" and "acknowledgements" mechanisms.

### Properties

This subsection is devoted to defining properties that the Cross-Chain Validation protocol ensures.
Recall that the parent blockchain has an ability to demand a change to the validator set of the baby chain.
Moreover, we want to ensure the stake of validators of the baby blockchain are "frozen" at the parent chain.

A change validator set demand is a tuple *(V, SN)*, where *V* represent a validator set updates and *SN* a sequence number of the demand.
If a change validator set demand *(V', SN')* is issued after a validator set demand *(V, SN)* by the staking module of the parent blockchain, then *SN' > SN*.

Hence, we aim to achieve the following properties:
- *Liveness*: If the staking module of the parent blockchain demands a validator set change *(V, SN)* for the baby chain and this demand is successfully relayed to the baby blockchain, then the validator set of the baby blockchain reflects this demand.
- *Validator set change safety*: Suppose that the validator set of the baby blockchain changes from *V* to *V'*. Then, there exists a sequence *seq = (V, SN(1)), (V, SN(2)), ..., (V, SN(n))*, where *n > 0*, of change validator set demands issued by the staking module of the parent blockchain such that *apply(V, seq) = V'*.
- *Stake safety*: If a validator *v* belongs to a validator set of the baby blockchain, then the stake of *v* is frozen at the parent blockchain. Moreover, if the stake of *v* is unfrozen at the parent blockchain, the unbonding period has elapsed for *v* at the baby blockchain.
- *Stake liveness*: If the stake of a validator *v* is bonded at the parent blockchain and the staking module of the parent blockchain demands a change to the validator set of the baby blockchain that does not contain *v*, eventually the stake of *v* is unbonded (although some stake might be slashed).

### Closer look at the IBC channels

An IBC channel assumes two parties (the respective blockchains) involved in the communication. However, it also assumes a relayer which handles message transmissions between the two blockchains. The relayer carries a central responsibility in ensuring communication between the two parties through the channel.

A relayer intermediates communication between the two blockchains. Each blockchain exposes an API comprising read, write, as well as a queue (FIFO) functionality. So there are two parts to the communication API:

- a read/write store: The read/write store holds the entire state of the chain. Each module can write to this store.
- a queue of datagrams (packets): Each module can dequeue datagrams stored in this queue and a relayer can queue to this queue.

## Data Structures

We devote this section to defining the data structures used to represent the states of both parent and baby blockchain, as well as the packets exchanged by the two blockchains.

### Application data

#### Parent blockchain

- Frozen stake: Keeps track of frozen stake of validators.
- Outcoming data store: "Part" of the blockchain observable for the relayer. Namely, each packet written in outcoming data store will be relayed by the relayer.

#### Baby blockchain

- Unbonding: Keeps track of validators that are currently unbonding.
- Validator set: The validator set of the baby blockchain.
- Sequence number: The sequence number of the **last** change validator set demand that influenced the current validator set of the baby blockchain.
- ValSet changes: Keeps track of all demands of the parent blockchain for a change of the validator set of the baby blockchain in a current block.
- Outcoming data store: "Part" of the blockchain used for storing the packets that should be relayed to the parent blockchain (same as at the parent blockchain).

### Packet data

#### Sent by the parent blockchain

- ChangeValidatorSet(validatorSet, seqNum): Packet sent by the parent blockchain to the baby blockchain to express the demand of the parent blockchain to modify the validator set of the baby blockchain.
Validator set modifications are defined in the *valSetUpdate* parameter, whereas the *seqNum* represents the unique identifier of the demand.

  *Remark:* There exists the acknowledgment packet for the ChangeValidatorSet packet. However, currently the acknowledgment packet does not influence any state transitions (as we introduce in the rest of the document).

#### Sent by the baby blockchain

- UnbondingOver(seqNums): Packet sent by the baby blockchain to signalize that the unbonding period has elapsed at the baby blockchain for every validator that is demanded in the *ChangeValidatorSet* packets with sequence numbers less than or equal to *seqNum*.

  *Remark:* There exists the acknowledgment packet for the UnbondingOver packet. However, currently the acknowledgment packet does not influence any state transitions (as we introduce in the rest of the document).


## Transitions

In this section, we informally discuss the state transitions that occur in our protocol.
We observe state transitions that are driven by a user (i.e., the new staking module on the parent chain), driven by the relayer and driven by elapsed time.

  - User-driven state transitions: These transitions "start" the entire process of changing the validator set of the baby blockchain.
  We assume that the staking module expresses the will to change the validator set of the baby blockchain. It is done at the End-Block method (as in the "single blockchain" scenario).

  - Transaction-driven state transitions: These are the state transitions that are driven by the relayer. Namely, these transitions are activated since communication between the two blockchains takes place. E.g., some packet is received via the IBC communication, a timeout has elapsed for a packet, acknowledgment for a packet is received.

  - Time-driven state transitions: These transitions are activated since some time has elapsed. As we will present in the rest of the document, time-driven state transitions help us determine when the unbonding period, measured at the baby blockchain, has elapsed for a validator set.

In the rest of the document, we will discuss the aforementioned state transitions in more detail.

## State Machine for a Single Validator Set Change demand

For simplicity in presentation, in this section we consider a *single* validator set change demand, that is, we assume that this demand will be a single committed validator set change demand in a block at the parent blockchain.
(If the relayer successfully transmits the protocol packet) this demand will result the validator set change indeed taking place at the baby blockchain.
However, in principle multiple demands can be issued before the first of those is finished. This leads to concurrency, and intermediate validator set changes may not be visible in the validator sets of the baby chain. We will discuss concurrency effects below.

We first describe the lifetime of a validator set change demand.
First, the staking module of the parent blockchain issues this demand by initiating the sending of the packet to the baby blockchain.
Once this packet is received by the baby blockchain, the validator set of the baby blockchain is updated to reflect the received packet and, from this point on, the "new" validator set is operating the baby blockchain.
However, once the validator set of the baby blockchain is updated, the "old" validator set starts unbonding.
Once the unbonding period for the validator set elapses, the *UnbondingOver* packet is sent to the parent blockchain.
Lastly, when the *UnbondingOver* packet is received by the parent blockchain, the stake of the validators is unfrozen.

We now present the state machine for this case.

## Function Definitions

### Functions provided by the staking module

In this subsection we explain which functions we assume are provided by the staking module.

```golang
// parent blockchain; used to unfreeze stake of validators associated with the change validator set demands (valSet, seqNum')
// where seqNum' <= seqNum
func unfreezeStake(seqNum)
```

- Implementation remark
    - This callback is used to signal the to user (the staking module) that it can unfreeze stake because the unbonding period expired on the baby chain. It is in the responsibility of the staking module to check how much should be unfrozen depending on what evidence was received (by other means than this protocol) before.
- Expected precondition
  - The change validator set demand *(valSet, seqNum)* issued by the staking module of the parent blockchain
- Expected postcondition
  - Stake of each validator from *valSet* associated with a sequence number *seqNum' <= seqNum* is unfrozen
- Error condition
  - If the precondition is violated

```golang
// parent blockchain; used to unfreeze stake of validators associated with the change validator set demands (valSet, seqNum)
func unfreezeSingleStake(seqNum)
```

- Expected precondition
  - The change validator set demand *(valSet, seqNum)* issued by the staking module of the parent blockchain
- Expected postcondition
  - Stake of each validator from *valSet* associated with a sequence number *seqNum* is unfrozen
- Error condition
  - If the precondition is violated

```golang
// baby blockchain; notes that the unbonding for the specific change validator set demand started at time *time*
func startUnbonding(seqNum, time)
```

- Expected precondition
  - The validator set of the baby blockchain reflects a change validator set demand *(V, SN)*, where *SN > seqNum*
  - End-Block method is executed for the block with bft time equals to *time*
- Expected postcondition
  - The staking module notes that the unbonding for the change validator set demand *(valSet, seqNum)* started at bft time *time*
- Error condition
  - If the precondition is violated

```golang
// baby blockchain; returns all change validator set demands that started unbonding at time T', where *time* - T' >= unbonding period
// and removes them from the data structure taking note of who is currently unbonding
// (i.e., subsequent finishUnbonding calls do not return this demand)
func finishUnbonding(time)
```

- Expected precondition
  - End-Block method is executed for the block with bft time equals to *time*
- Expected postcondition
  - Returns (and removes from the data structure) all validator set change demands *(V, SN)* such that *startUnbonding(SN, time')* is invoked, where *time - time' >= unbonding period*
- Error condition
  - If the precondition is violated

**Remark.** The staking module of the baby chain needs to take care of a queue *validatorSetChangeQueue* which is used to store observed change validator set demands.
This queue is manipulated using *sizeValidatorSetChangeQueue()* to retrieve the size of the queue, *dequeueValidatorSetChange()* and *queueValidatorSetChange(valSet, seqNum)* to dequeue and queue the *validatorSetChange* queue, respectively.

### Parent blockchain

This subsection will present the functions executed at the parent blockchain.

```golang
// invoked by the staking module of the parent blockchain to
// express will to modify the validator set of the baby blockchain;
// executed in the End-Block method; similarly to the "normal, single-blockchain" case
func changeValidatorSet(
  babyChainId: ChainId
  valSetUpdate: Validator[]
  seqNum: integer) {
  // create the ChangeValidatorSet packet
  ChangeValidatorSet data = ChangeValidatorSet{valSetUpdate, seqNum}

  // obtain the destination port of the baby blockchain
  destPort = getPort(babyChainId)

  // send the packet
  handler.sendPacket(Packet{timeoutHeight, timeoutTimestamp, destPort, destChannel, sourcePort, sourceChannel, data}, getCapability("port"))
}
```

- Expected precondition
  - There exists a blockchain with *babyChainId* identifier
  - All validators from *valSetUpdate* are validators at the parent blockchain
  - Stake of each validator from *valSetUpdate* is frozen and associated with this demand (via *seqNum*)
- Expected postcondition
  - The packet containing information about this change validator set demand is created
- Error condition
  - If the precondition is violated

```golang
// executed at the parent blockchain to handle a delivery of the IBC packet
func onRecvPacket(packet: Packet) {
  // the packet is of UnbondingOver type
  assert(packet.type = UnbondingOver)

  seqNum = packet.seqNums

  // unfreeze stake of validators associated with sequence numbers <= seqNum
  stakingModule.unfreezeStake(seqNum)

  // construct the default acknowledgment
  ack = defaultAck(UnbondingOver)
  return ack
}
```

- Expected precondition
  - The *ChangeValidatorSet* packet is sent to the baby blockchain before this packet is received
  - The packet is of the *UnbondingOver* type
- Expected postcondition
  - Stake of each validator from *valSet* associated with a sequence number *seqNum* is unfrozen
  - The default acknowledgment is created
- Error condition
  - If the precondition is violated

```golang
// called once a sent packet has timed-out
function onTimeoutPacket(packet: Packet) {
  // the packet is of ChangeValidatorSet type
  assert(packet.type = ChangeValidatorSet)

  valSet = packet.valSet
  seqNum = packet.seqNum

  // unfreeze stake of validators associated with this seqNum
  stakingModule.unfreezeSingleStake(seqNum)
}
```

- Expected precondition
  - The *packet* has timed out
- Expected postcondition
  - Stake of each validator from *valSet* associated with a sequence number *seqNum* is unfrozen
- Error condition
  - If the precondition is violated  

### Baby blockchain

```golang
// executed at the baby blockchain to handle a delivery of the IBC packet
func onRecvPacket(packet: Packet) {
  // the packet is of ChangeValidatorSet type
  assert(packet.type = ChangeValidatorSet)

  valSetUpdate = packet.valSetUpdate
  seqNum = packet.seqNum

  // inform the staking module of the new validator set change demand
  stakingModule.queueValidatorSetChange(valSetUpdate, seqNum)

  // construct the default acknowledgment
  ack = defaultAck(ChangeValidatorSet)
  return ack
}
```

- Expected precondition
  - The packet is of the *ChangeValidatorSet* type
- Expected postcondition
  - The staking module queues the new validator set change demand
  - The default acknowledgment is created
- Error condition
  - If the precondition is violated

```golang
// End-Block method executed at the end of each block
func endBlock(block: Block) {
  // get time
  time = block.time

  // get the old validator set
  oldValSet, oldSeqNum = block.validatorSet

  // get the new validator set; init to the old one
  newValSet = oldValSet

  // start unbonding for the old validator set represented by the validator set update
  stakingModule.startUnbonding(oldSeqNum, time)

  // update the validator set
  while (stakingModule.sizeValidatorSetChangeQueue() > 0) {
    valSetUpdate, valSetUpdateSeqNum = stakingModule.dequeueValidatorSetChange()

    // update the new validator set
    newValSet = applyValidatorUpdate(newValSet, valSetUpdate)

    // remember which demands participate
    if (stakingModule.sizeValidatorSetChangeQueue() = 0) {
      newSeqNum = valSetUpdateSeqNum
    }
  }

  // finish unbonding for mature validator sets
  // ordered increasingly
  for each (seqNum in stakingModule.finishUnbondingOrdered(time)) {
    // create the UnbondingOver packet
    UnbondingOver data = UnbondingOver{seqNum}

    // obtain the destination port of the baby blockchain
    destPort = getPort(parentChainId)

    // send the packet
    handler.sendPacket(Packet{timeoutHeight, timeoutTimestamp, destPort, destChannel, sourcePort, sourceChannel, data}, getCapability("port"))
  }

  return newValSet, newSeqNum
}
```

- Expected precondition
  - Every transaction from the *block* is executed
- Expected postcondition
  - Unbonding starts for the old validator set
  - Unbonding finishes for all validator set that started unbonding more than *unbondingTime* before *time = block.time*. Moreover, the *UnbondingOver* packet is created for each such validator set
  - The new validator set *newValSet* is pushed to the Tendermint protocol and *newValSet* reflects all the change validator set demands from the *block*
- Error condition
  - If the precondition is violated



```golang
// called once a sent packet has timed-out
function onTimeoutPacket(packet: Packet) {
  // the packet is of UbondingOver type
  assert(packet.type = UnbondingOver)

  seqNum = packet.seqNum

  // create the UnbondingOver packet
  UnbondingOver data = UnbondingOver{seqNum}

  // obtain the destination port of the baby blockchain
  destPort = getPort(parentChainId)

  // send the packet
  handler.sendPacket(Packet{timeoutHeight, timeoutTimestamp, destPort, destChannel, sourcePort, sourceChannel, data}, getCapability("port"))
}
```

- Expected precondition
  - The *packet* has timed out
- Expected postcondition
  - The *UnbondingOver* packet is created again
- Error condition
  - If the precondition is violated


### Port & channel setup

The `setup` function must be called exactly once when the module is created
to bind to the appropriate port.

```golang
func setup() {
  capability = routingModule.bindPort("cross-chain staking", ModuleCallbacks{
    onChanOpenInit,
    onChanOpenTry,
    onChanOpenAck,
    onChanOpenConfirm,
    onChanCloseInit,
    onChanCloseConfirm,
    onRecvPacket,
    onTimeoutPacket,
    onAcknowledgePacket,
    onTimeoutPacketClose
  })
  claimCapability("port", capability)
}
```

Once the `setup` function has been called, channels can be created through the IBC routing module
between instances of the cross-chain staking modules on mother and daughter chains.

##### Channel lifecycle management

Mother and daughter chains accept new channels from any module on another machine, if and only if:

- The channel being created is ordered.
- The version string is `icsXXX`.

```golang
func onChanOpenInit(
  order: ChannelOrder,
  connectionHops: [Identifier],
  portIdentifier: Identifier,
  channelIdentifier: Identifier,
  counterpartyPortIdentifier: Identifier,
  counterpartyChannelIdentifier: Identifier,
  version: string) {
  // only ordered channels allowed
  abortTransactionUnless(order === ORDERED)
  // assert that version is "icsXXX"
  abortTransactionUnless(version === "icsXXX")
}
```

```golang
func onChanOpenTry(
  order: ChannelOrder,
  connectionHops: [Identifier],
  portIdentifier: Identifier,
  channelIdentifier: Identifier,
  counterpartyPortIdentifier: Identifier,
  counterpartyChannelIdentifier: Identifier,
  version: string,
  counterpartyVersion: string) {
  // only ordered channels allowed
  abortTransactionUnless(order === ORDERED)
  // assert that version is "icsXXX"
  abortTransactionUnless(version === "icsXXX")
  abortTransactionUnless(counterpartyVersion === "icsXXX")
}
```

```golang
func onChanOpenAck(
  portIdentifier: Identifier,
  channelIdentifier: Identifier,
  version: string) {
  // port has already been validated
  // assert that version is "icsXXX"
  abortTransactionUnless(version === "icsXXX")
}
```

```golang
func onChanOpenConfirm(
  portIdentifier: Identifier,
  channelIdentifier: Identifier) {
  // accept channel confirmations, port has already been validated, version has already been validated
}
```

```golang
func onChanCloseInit(
  portIdentifier: Identifier,
  channelIdentifier: Identifier) {
  // the channel is closing, do we need to punish?
}
```

```golang
func onChanCloseConfirm(
  portIdentifier: Identifier,
  channelIdentifier: Identifier) {
  // the channel is closed, do we need to punish?
}
```

## State Machine for Multiple Validator Set Change demands

Note that "multiple" signalizes that more than one demand of the change validator set type is committed in a block at the baby blockchain.
If that happens, all updates take place.
Note that some updates might not be visible, i.e., their effect might be hidden by subsequent demands.

The image below illustrates this case.
![image](./images/data_flow_2.png)


## Correctness Arguments

Here we provide correctness arguments for the liveness, stake safety and stake liveness properties.

### Liveness
Suppose that the IBC communication indeed successfully relays the demand *ChangeValidatorSet(V, SN)* to the baby blockchain.
Therefore, the validator set of the baby blockchain should reflect this demand.
This indeed happens at the end of a block, since every observed demand is applied in order for the baby blockchain to calculate the new validator set.
Hence, the property is satisfied.

### Validator set change safety
Suppose that the validator set of the baby blockchain changes from *V* to *V'* in two consecutive blocks.
By construction of the protocol, we conclude that there exists a sequence of change validator set demands issued by the parent blockchain that result in *V'* when applied to *V*.
Recursively, we conclude that this holds for any two validator sets (irrespectively of the "block distance" between them).

### Stake safety

If the validator *v* belong to the validator set of the baby blockchain, we know that a *ChangeValidatorSet(V, SN)* is demanded by the parent blockchain, where *v in V*.
Since the stake is frozen at the moment of sending this demand, the first statement of the property is satisfied.

A stake of a validator *v* is unfrozen at the parent blockchain upon a reception of the *UnbondingOver* packet.
Since this packet is sent by the baby blockchain only after the unbonding period has elapsed, the second claim of the property holds.

### Stake liveness
The unbonding period for each validator eventually elapses.
Since the *UnbondingOver* packet is resent until the packet is received by the parent blockchain, the stake is eventually unfrozen.

## Generalization

Note that we assume a single baby blockchain per a parent blockchain.
However, the protocol itself allows that a single parent blockchain takes care of multiple baby blockchains.
The only difference would be that the parent blockchain takes care of each "cross-chain validation"-related parameter **per** baby blockchain (i.e., the sequence numbers for the change validator set demands would be **per** baby blockchain, the "stake freezing" logic would be **per** baby blockchain, etc.).
